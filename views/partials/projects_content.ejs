    This project was done in my first semester. I was in a group working on our first 
    2D game using Unity. We all had a part in the conceptualization and documentation 
    of our idea for the game. We decided to create a top-down shooter set on an alien planet.
    The player controls a soldier who must fight enemy aliens and search for surviving colonists.
    When development started my role was to make the HUD, textboxes, menus, and reticle. We 
    ended up completing all the tasks we had set and were proud of our final product.

    This project was something I worked on in my free time over the course of a couple months. 
    This collection is of me and my siblings. I used GIMP to draw each picture and when they were done 
    they were made into 16in x 16in acrylic prints.

    This project is currently in progress. I am in a group working on a 2D game using Unity.
    We have been working on the conceptualization and documentation of our idea, and we are 
    beginning to start development. We will be creating our own assets, scripting, making 
    levels, and testing our game. This game will be a 2D side scrolling platformer. The player 
    controls a fire spirit and they must avoid traps and defeat enemies to complete the game.
